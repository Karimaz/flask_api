<b> Basic QR Code API for personal Use </b>
Flask Api for qr codes for contact Cards (VC files)

Post the Data u need to put in the QR-code Data with this Format:

{
    "last_name": "Name",
    "first_name": "Fname",
    "company": "Company Inc.",
    "work_phone": "+102695 65 65 ",
    "mobile_phone": "+49-1515 51 51 51",
    "work_address_line_1": "Muenster Str. 119",
    "work_address_city": "Dortmund",
    "work_address_stage_code": "NRW",
    "work_address_pin": "44145",
    "work_address_country": "Germany",
    "email": "hello@email-eg.com",
    "url": "www.example.de"
}

and u would get the Qr as <b>.PNG </b> file in Blue ..

Would add more options in the coming weeks..
